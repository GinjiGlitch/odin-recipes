  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 chicken breasts cut into halves</li>
    <li>cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <li>flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of drained capers</li>
    <li>1/2 a cup of whitw wine</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of chopped parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
    <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
    <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
  </ol>
